%  How to fill out this application form?
%
%  IMPORTANT: When writing your proposal, please take into account that it will be assessed by both expert referees
%  as well as more broadly composed cluster committees and domain wide assessment committees.
%
% This application form consists of two parts. Part A is devoted to the scientific proposal, including abstract, summary and a
% justification for the project budget.Part B contains the name and affiliation of the main applicant and additional
% information which is not immediately necessary for the scientific proposal but contains administrative information aiding
% the assessment procedure. Only Part A will be assessed by the referees and the cluster and domain wide assessment
% committees. Please adhere to the following rules when filling out this application form:
% * remove the examples and comments before converting the application to PDF and submitting it;
% * use the font and size as specified in the .sty-file and do not change the margins (2 cm in either direction);
% * each of the two Parts A and B should start on a new page;
% * no budget table should be included in this application form; please use the separately provided spreadsheet to 
%    construct your budget table and upload the pdf of it together with this application form;
% * the basic details of the proposal (section A.1, incl. abstract and summary) are limited to one page;
% * the scientific proposal (section A.2) is limited to six pages, which includes figures and tables, but excludes the 
%    list of literature references.
% * it is not allowed to include hyperlinks to a personal website, to a group website or to similar information which, in fact,
%    extends the page limit set;
% * it is not allowed to include ‘CV information’ such as prizes, (prestigious) grants, et cetera;
% * NWO signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). DORA aims to call a halt to the
%    irresponsible use of bibliometric indicators in assessing research and researchers (such as the H-index, Journal Impact Factor and
%    citations). It is a global initiative for all research disciplines (for more information about this, see https://sfdora.org/). NWO
%    implements its principles in all instruments. Therefore it is not allowed to mention H-indices, Journal  Impact Factors, overall citations
%    or similar bibliometric indicators in M-applications. It is allowed to mention the number of citations of a single output item that is
%    relevant to the proposed research;
% * it is not allowed to include letters of support or documents other than required.
 
% What to submit to NWO through ISAAC?
% Upload as a separate pdf:
% * Application form
% * Budget table
% * If applicable: letter request for preferential treatment signed by applicant
% * If applicable: employer's statement when 
%       ~ preferential treatment is being applied for (including extension clause)
%       ~ the contract of the applicant (tenure track or upcoming retirement) does not cover the runtime of the project:
%           guarantee adequate supervision of the to be appointed personnel

%\bibliographystyle{unsrt}



%\section{Literature references}
%  The list of references should be relevant to the research proposal, cited in the texts of section A.2, and only include
%  'open literature'. It should not include internal documents (such as master theses) nor be a mere list of publications of
%  the main applicant. This section does not count toward the limitation of six pages.
